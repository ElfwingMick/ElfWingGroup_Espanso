      Hi, {{name}}, this is Andrew from Elf Wing, you placed an order with us on eBay.

      Due to shipping and supplier reasons, we are currently switching A&C paper to C&S papers of the same quality, size and price. So we would be shipping C&S paper products to you instead for your order.

      We are just confirming with you to see if thats all clear with you.

      Thank you, 
      Elf Wing
